# 🐧 Linux for DevOps Engineers

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that powers:

- 🌍 Most web servers
- ☁️ All cloud infrastructure
- 📦 Every container (Docker/Kubernetes)
- 🔧 DevOps automation tools (Jenkins, Ansible, etc.)

---

## 💡 Why DevOps Engineers Must Know Linux

- All deployments, monitoring, and builds typically run on Linux servers.
- Tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Jenkins, etc., are native to Linux.
- Scripting, automation, cron jobs, and system monitoring rely heavily on Linux skills.

---

## 🧠 Shell Basics

```bash
whoami       # Current user
uname -a     # Kernel and OS info
hostname     # Server name
uptime       # System load and uptime
```

### What is a Shell?

A **shell** is a program that takes your input (commands), interprets them, and tells the OS what to do.  
In Linux, the default is usually **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**.

---

## 📁 Navigation & File Listing

```bash
pwd         # Show current directory
cd /etc     # Go to /etc
cd ~        # Home directory
cd ..       # One level up

ls          # List files
ls -l       # Long listing
ls -a       # Show hidden files
ls -lh      # Human-readable sizes
ls -ltr     # Sort by modified time
```

---

## 📄 Viewing Files

```bash
cat filename         # Print entire file
less filename        # Scrollable viewer
head -n 20 file.log  # First 20 lines
tail -n 50 file.log  # Last 50 lines
tail -f file.log     # Follow live logs
```

---

## ⚙️ Terminal Essentials

```bash
clear     # Clear screen
history   # Show command history
!!        # Repeat last command
!50       # Run command number 50
```

➡️ **TAB key** → Auto-complete commands and file paths

## 🌲 Linux Directory Structure

Linux uses a **hierarchical tree structure**, rooted at `/`.

| Directory | Description | DevOps Relevance |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `/` | Root of file system | Starting point |
| `/bin` | Essential binaries | Core commands |
| `/sbin` | System binaries | Admin tools |
| `/etc` | Config files | nginx.conf, crontab |
| `/var` | Logs, spools | System & app logs |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files | Cleared on reboot |
| `/home` | User data | Developer environment |
| `/proc` | Virtual files | System info |
| `/dev` | Devices | Mounted disks, USB |
| `/opt` | Optional software | 3rd-party tools |

---

## 💾 Disk & Directory Info

```bash
df -h            # Disk usage
du -sh *         # Size of directories
tree -L 2 /etc   # View structure (if installed)
ls -ld */        # Show only folders
```

---

## 🔍 Finding Files

```bash
find /etc -name "*.conf"           # Config files
find /var/log -type f -mtime +7    # Old logs
locate nginx.conf                  # Fast search
sudo updatedb                     # Index files for locate
```

---

## ✏️ File Management

```bash
mkdir folder               # New folder
mkdir -p a/b/c             # Nested folders
touch file.txt             # Create file
cp file.txt /tmp/          # Copy
cp -r src/ dest/           # Copy recursively
mv file1 file2             # Rename/move
rm file.txt                # Delete file
rm -rf folder/             # Force delete (⚠️ risky!)
```

### DevOps Tip:

```bash
alias rm='rm -i'  # Confirm before deleting
```

---

## 🔐 Permissions & Ownership

```bash
ls -l file.txt        # View permissions
chmod 755 script.sh   # rwxr-xr-x
chmod +x script.sh    # Make executable
chown user:group file # Change ownership
```

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `r`    | Read    |
| `w`    | Write   |
| `x`    | Execute |
| `-`    | None    |

> `chmod 400 key.pem` → Read-only for owner  
> `chmod 700 script.sh` → Only owner can read/write/execute

---

## 🧬 Processes & Services

| Concept | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Process | Any running program | `bash`, `nginx` |
| Service | Background task managed by system | `sshd`, `docker` |

```bash
ps aux / ps -ef       # Show all processes
top / htop            # Live system monitor
kill <PID>            # Graceful kill
kill -9 <PID>         # Force kill
pkill nginx           # Kill by name
```

---

## 🛠 Managing Services

```bash
systemctl status nginx     # Check status
sudo systemctl start nginx # Start
sudo systemctl stop nginx  # Stop
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx  # Start on boot
```

---

## 🌐 Check Network Ports

```bash
ss -tuln        # Open ports
netstat -tuln   # Legacy tool
```

Common Ports:
- `22` → SSH  
- `80/443` → Web  
- `8080` → Jenkins  
- `3306` → MySQL  
- `5432` → PostgreSQL

---

## 📜 Bash Scripting

Scripts automate everything from deployments to monitoring.

### Basic Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, DevOps World!"
```

### Running Scripts

```bash
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

---

## 🧮 Variables & Math

```bash
name="DevOps"
echo "Hello, $name"

a=5
b=3
sum=$((a + b))
echo "Sum: $sum"
```

- `readonly` → Lock variable  
- `unset` → Delete variable

---

## 🔡 User Input & Args

```bash
read -p "Enter env: " env
echo "Deploying to $env"
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
env=$1
echo "Deploying to $env"
```

- `$#` → Number of args  
- `$@` → All args  
- `shift` → Move through args

---

## 🔀 Conditionals

```bash
if [ "$name" == "admin" ]; then
  echo "Welcome, admin!"
fi

if [ -f myfile.txt ]; then
  echo "File exists"
fi
```

### Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-f` | File exists |
| `-d` | Directory exists |
| `-z` | Empty string |
| `-n` | Not empty |

---

## 🔁 Loops

### `for` Loop

```bash
for file in *.log; do
  mv "$file" archive/
done
```

### `while` Loop

```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 3 ]; do
  echo "Try #$count"
  ((count++))
done
```

---

## ⚙️ Functions in Bash

```bash
say_hello() {
  echo "Hello!"
}

greet_user() {
  echo "Hi, $1!"
}
greet_user "Maktum"
```

Return exit codes using `return`, return strings via `echo + command substitution`:

```bash
get_hostname() {
  echo "$(hostname)"
}

host=$(get_hostname)
echo "Server: $host"
```

---

## ✅ Real-World DevOps Use Cases

- Automated deployments via bash scripts
- Parsing logs
- Running scheduled tasks (cron jobs)
- Restarting services
- Managing users, directories, and backups

Let me know when you're ready to upload it, or if you want to split it into smaller subtopics (`01_shell.md`, `02_permissions.md`, etc.) — or move on to enhancing the `Scripts/` folder!
